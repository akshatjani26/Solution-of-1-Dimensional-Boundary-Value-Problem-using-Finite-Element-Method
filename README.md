# Solution-of-1-Dimensional-Boundary-Value-Problem-using-Finite-Element-Method
## M.Tech Course Project: FEM for Fluids (AE 618)

– Performed the Weak and Gallerkin formulations of the problem. Built a MATLAB algorithm to assemble the Element-Level Stiffness Matrices, Force Vectors and solved the system of linear equations from the available mathematics library
– Estimated and Plotted the relative error demonstrating the accuracy of the method by varying the no. of elements & element size
